## WAV (Waveform Audio File Format)

### Audio Quality and Bit Depth Options
- 16-bit: Standard CD quality, suitable for most consumer audio
- 24-bit: Professional audio standard, professional recording, mixing, mastering
- 32-bit float: High-precision audio production, maximum headroom, ideal for digital audio workstations
- 8-bit: Low-quality, minimal file size,  limited dynamic range, noticeable quantization noise

### File Size Calculation

You can approximately calculate output file.

- File Size = (Sample Rate × Bit Depth × Channels × Duration) ÷ 8
- Example: 44.1 kHz, 16-bit, stereo, 3-minute track ≈ 30-40 MB
