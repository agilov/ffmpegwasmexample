## M4A (MPEG-4 Audio)

Advanced Audio Coding (AAC) compression.
More efficient than MP3 with better sound quality at same bitrate.
Part of MPEG-4 container format developed by Apple and widely supported.
People often call it AAC format, but AAC is codec, not file container.

### Audio Quality and Bitrate Options

#### Constant Bitrate (CBR)
- 96 kbps: Low quality
- 128 kbps: Standard quality (Suitable for speech, podcasts, smaller file size)
- 192 kbps: High quality (Good for most music streaming, balance between quality and file size)
- 256 kbps: Very high quality
- 320 kbps: Near-lossless quality - recommended for music enthusiasts

#### Variable Bitrate (VBR)
- Scale: 0-9 (0 = highest quality, 9 = lowest)
- Dynamically adjusts bitrate based on audio complexity
- Typically more efficient than CBR
